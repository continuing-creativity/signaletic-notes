# Signaletic Examples

## To Do
- [x] A simple oscillator and envelope example
- [x] FM synthesis example where a node is connected to multiple inputs
- [ ] Multiple inputs/output and channel up/down mixing
- [ ] Audio buffers
- [ ] Implementations of the routing examples in the Web Audio API specification
- [ ]A cyclic node arrangement using a DelayNode (From the spec: "It is possible to connect an AudioNode to another AudioNode which creates a cycle: an AudioNode may connect to another AudioNode, which in turn connects back to the first AudioNode. This is allowed only if there is at least one DelayNode in the cycle")
